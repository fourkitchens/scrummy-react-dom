    <div className="text">
      <p><strong>Scrummy is</strong> a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker">story point estimation game</a> for scrum teams, developed by the Web Chefs at <a href="http://www.fourkitchens.com">Four Kitchens</a> to allow easier participation by remote team members and to experiment with some new technologies.</p>
      <p><strong>To begin,</strong> type a nickname and click <em>Play</em> or <em>Watch</em> to begin. If you received a link from another player, you will be added to that game. Otherwise, a new game will be created for you. Invite others by sharing your <em>game link</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>While playing,</strong> vote by clicking on a card in your hand. Withdraw a vote by clicking the same card; click another card to change your vote. The <em>Reveal</em> and <em>Reset</em> buttons affect everyone, so only use them when your team is ready.</p>
